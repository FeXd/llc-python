# Ladies Learning Code

## Intro to Python

A full day introductory Python workshop.

We use csv data from the [Canadian UFO Survey](http://survey.canadianuforeport.com/) and show learners how to open, read, and search for UFO sightings.

Created by [Gabriel Gosselin](https://twitter.com/fggosselin) and [Darcie Milliken](https://twitter.com/derushie) for Ladies Learning Code.

### Contributing

The graphics were created with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Please use it as well (or contact us for help!) to keep images looking consistent. 

This project uses [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding style. Make sure your text editor has an editorconfig [plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) installed.

**Atom Users:** The Whitespace plugin (which is installed by default) has `Trim trailing whitespace` option turned on by default. Turn this off in the Whitespace plugin settings, otherwise it overwrites the setting in [.editorconfig](.editorconfig). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig/issues/3). This is only required for editing the slides. Workshop learners are not required to add this plugin.

Please refer to https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-slidedeck-template for instructions for customization of the slide deck and features.

### Tips for Instructors

For the mentor huddle: 
* Some mac users might fail to set up pycharm correctly with python 3. Before the workshop coach the mentors to handle this locally and not get side-tracked with the whole group explaining the python 2 vs. 3 differences
* Avoid getting side tracked by higher level discussions, especially in the data structures sections. In your mentor huddle, remind your mentors of this
* Instruct the mentors to keep feedback or suggestions on the content to themselves during the workshop and discuss with you during a break

For mentor introductions: 
* Encourage the mentors to share how they use python (work? side projects?)
* If you like, share local python user groups or meetups

Content notes:
* When you introduce pycharm and IDEs, give them a tour around the tool, show them how to show/hide windows, file tabs, navigate the project explorer, etc. Take your time with this.
* Configure your font size in pycharm before the workshop. Ctrl + zoom does not work in pycharm, the setting is under File > Settings > Editor > Font. Increase the font size to at least 16
* Sometimes the green 'run' arrow in pycharm vanishes. That can mean the code in the py file is not valid. Learners can right click on the tab and run the file that way as well.
* Feel free to come up with and explore your own examples, especially in the data structures and functions sections.
* Code sections prefixed by `>>>` are meant to be run in the console. 
* Indented code should be run in .py files 
* If you are running out of time, you can run the individual exercises as code-alongs but there is no need to pressure yourself to get through all the content.
